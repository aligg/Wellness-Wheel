# Wellness-Wheel
App built on React with the goal to inspire first time open source contributors or those looking to get started coding in React for the first time. The app displays words and images to instill calm or cheer and provide some respite.

# Getting Started
* Checkout the repository onto your local machine
* Run `yarn install` to add needed dependencies
* Run `yarn watch` to get the app running locally

I've added some issues for ideas on how you can contribute. Please feel free to file additional issues if you have more ideas.

Feel free to update this README as we go along to help others get through spots where you may have struggled or noticed where the instructions could be more clear. Happy coding and thank you for contributing and being a part of this project! 

# Happy Coding
